    ///   A FaceSnapSpace is a 2D coordinate system overlayed on a face. A FaceSnapSpace is used to 'snap a face from a
    ///   source mesh onto a face of a target mesh' so its properties are defined by the target face. The axes are: the
    ///   most representative edge of the face, the face's normal and their cross product. The most representative edge
    ///   of a face is the one that is perpendicular that greatest number of other edges. This allows the FaceSnapSpace
    ///   to naturally align with as many edges as possible. Its rotation can then be defined as the rotational
    ///   difference from the unit axes to its axes and its origin is the center of the face.
    ///   
    ///   When an MMesh is snapped to a FaceSnapSpace its rotation is changed so that the source face is parallel with
    ///   the target face and its moved so that the faces are flush. The source face will automatically stick to
    ///   important points on the target face. Corners will stick to corners, edges to edges and centers to centers
    ///   if the distance between them is within a threshold. If GridMode is on the MMesh will also move in grid units
